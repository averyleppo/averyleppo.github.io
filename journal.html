<p>#1: I have learned how to make a navigation bar, put words or images on a website, change the style of a website, add hovering effects and some other cool stuff. I am feeling pretty good about all of these things, I just think that with more practice I will be able to do it better and faster. I am working on coding my own website and styling it the way I want it to look. I’m a little frustrated with placing certain words in certain places, but other than that it's a lot of fun! I’m excited to continue to style it because I like things to look a certain way and I’m able to code that! I would love to start working on a new big project (tbd) or finish touching up my celiac website.</p>

<br>

<p>#2: I'm still working on my main website and thinking of how I want to style it. I started my gift for Carter's birthday today and I'm really excited. Today's class was really chill which was super nice and now I know how to put my code on line through github!
</p>

<br>

<p>#3: I learned how to make stuff animated so I'm trying to apply it to my gift for Carter's birthday! I got photoshop on my computer so I'm almost ready to start adding the boxes about our inside jokes onto the website when the ball goes in the hoop. I'm having a little difficulty finding the right spot for the ball to stop but that's just trial and error. I want to learn how to make the ball have multiple "stops" when it travels to make it look like it's a curved shot into the hoop. 
</p>

<br>

<p>#4: I finished making the basketball travel into the hoop and have it do that whenever I click on it. Now I'm working on trying to make a message pop up on my screen when I click the on the ball. A function is a command that makes a something happen to have your chosen outcome. You make a function run by using parenthesis to initiate the function and you use the brackets to say what you want to happen. Some words I know are: keyFrames, addEventListener, console.log, var, document.getElementById and some more. 
</p>

<br>

<p>#5: I finished Carter and Kiera's gifts! I want to try to continue to work on Kiera's and learn how to add audio that can play automatically to the website. I taught myself how to add the audio file, but I just need help learning how to make it play when I click on the ball. I made a website where random colors are generated so I could practice how to code those. I also made a website with a softball on it and it moves when you click on it to practice my knowledge about functions.
</p>

<br>

<p>#6: I made some changes to the softball batting simulation so that now the batter changes back to their initial position, similar to how the ball goes back. I'm now working on a website that allows softball players to practice knowing their cuts by creating a random spot on one of the 3 bases when you click on a button. I also made a code that makes the Mystery Machine pop up all over the screen and when you click on it, it changes to Scooby Doo. I'm interested in working on something zodiac sign related or even maybe a quote generator. 
</p>

<br>

<p>#7: I am working with Sophia on a mini-project where we are throwing a ball back and forth with switching images. I also also working on a project where when you click on the turkey, a message about what I am thankful for pops up. The messages will be random when clicked, but right now they are only showing in the console and not on the website, so I am going to try to fix that glitch. I am also still working on the cutoff practice for softball, I just want to figure out how I want it to work/look.
</p>

<br>

<p>#8: Sophia and I finished our mini project and I learned a more effeciant way to organize my functions to make it easier to understand. I also just finished the thanksgiving thankful turkey project and I'm really happy with how it came out becasue I was able to figure out how to use text instead of images for the messages that pop up. I'm still working on the softball cut off project and I just finished making a "next" button to randomize the blue dot. I'm now trying to figure out how to make multiple dots pop up. 
</p>

<br>

<p>#9: I was able to figure out how to make two dots for the softball cutoff practice code and now I am just going to try to make a scoreboard so that when I click on something it will add points to it. I did my electronic drum kit presentation and linked it to my website. I also finalized my favorite song generator code. Now, I am working on a holiday gift for my parents. I am going to make it so that when I click on a candle, a photo pops up of me and my family.
